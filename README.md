# minimute

A single-function app to quickly mute/unmute the microphone during conf calls. It works
no matter which app is in the foreground, and makes it easy to tell if you're muted or not.

## Install instructions
To have it start when Windows starts: 
- Windows+R -> "shell:startup" -> copy minimute.exe to that folder, or create a shell link and copy the link

To make the minimute icon always visible in system tray:
1. Windows+S -> "select which icons appear on the taskbar" -> \<enter\>
2. Locate "minimute" in the list and switch to "on"
